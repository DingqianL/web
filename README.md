Hi, thanks for visiting the repository of my webpage. You are welcomed to:

1. Use this repository for learning purpose, with copy/paste codes less than 10 lines of each ".html" file.
2. Browse all my files.
3. Download the data and pictures which are under the research page. I have this page to share my code and data for the published work.
4. Use my data and code for duplication or learning purpose.


I'm strongly against the following actions:

1. Fork or Copy my files without reaching out to me and having my agreement;
2. Download/share other pictures which are not under the research page. For example, my ourdoor activity pictures.
3. Use my page, data and code for commercial purpose.

I, Dingqian Liu, reserve the right to explain and modify the statements above.
